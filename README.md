# TryJS

A fast, free JavaScript & TypeScript playground that runs entirely in your browser. Write code, see output instantly — no setup, no backend.

**Live:** [tryjs.app](https://tryjs.app) · **Features:** [tryjs.app/features](https://tryjs.app/features)

## Features

- **Instant execution** — code auto-runs on change with debounce; `Cmd+Enter` runs immediately
- **JavaScript & TypeScript** — toggle with one click; TypeScript is transpiled in-browser via Sucrase
- **NPM imports** — bare specifiers like `import confetti from "canvas-confetti"` are rewritten to esm.sh and executed in the sandbox
- **Web Playground** — switch to a tabbed HTML/CSS/JS editor with live preview and built-in console
- **Snippet gallery** — ready-to-run examples across JS fundamentals, async patterns, and TypeScript essentials
- **Share & embed** — copy a URL that preserves editor state, or embed as an iframe in docs and blog posts
- **Export as image** — generate code screenshots with syntax themes, Safari/minimal frames, padding options, and gradient backgrounds (download PNG or copy to clipboard)
- **REPL-style evaluation** — bare expressions display their result in the console, like Chrome DevTools
- **Console output** — supports `log`, `warn`, `error`, `info`, `table`, `time`/`timeEnd`, and `clear`
- **Sandboxed execution** — code runs in an iframe sandbox with a 5-second timeout
- **6 syntax themes** — One Dark, One Light, Dracula, GitHub Light, Monokai, Solarized Dark
- **3 editor fonts** — Geist Mono, Fira Code, JetBrains Mono
- **Resizable split pane** — drag the divider between editor and console
- **Code persistence** — saved to localStorage per language
- **Mobile support** — editor/console tabs on small screens
- **Features page** — SEO-friendly landing page at `/features`

## Roadmap

What's coming next — features we're actively exploring:

- **🔍 Console Object Inspector** — expand and collapse objects, arrays, Maps, and Sets inline, just like Chrome DevTools
- **📁 Multi-file Tabs** — create multiple files, import between them, and build real modules in the browser
- **🤖 AI Assist** — explain code, fix errors, and generate snippets with an inline AI assistant
- **⚡ Live HTML/CSS Preview** — render HTML & CSS output in a live preview panel alongside the console
- **💾 GitHub Gist Sync** — save your playground to a Gist and load any Gist as a playground with one click
